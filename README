Pillow is a combined router and rereducer for CouchDB.

Dependencies (Both of these are included in this git repository):
- webmachine
- ibrowse from jungerl

Needless to say, it also depends indirectly on couchdb. There is no direct dependencies, but what use is a router
or rereducer for CouchDB without CouchDB. 

Roadmap:
The current goal is to add resharding to Pillow. 
1. Automatic generation of resharding validate functions *Done*
2. Automatic resharding using validate functions *Done*
3. CouchDB style config files
4. Resharding controlled through config files (original, resharding, final)
   The original config file defines how routing will be done, the resharding
   one controls how resharding will be done meaning it has both the before
   and after configs and the after config will not be used actively at this step.
   When the final config file which is of the same format as the original is
   enabled, the new sharding setup is used and the old servers may be torn
   down.
5. End-to-end resharding through a single call
