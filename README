Pillow is a combined router and rereducer for CouchDB.

Dependencies (Both of these are included in this git repository):
- webmachine
- ibrowse from jungerl

Needless to say, it also depends indirectly on couchdb. There is no direct dependencies, but what use is a router
or rereducer for CouchDB without CouchDB. 

Roadmap:
The current goal is to add resharding to Pillow. 
1. Automatic generation of resharding validate functions *Done*
2. Automatic resharding using validate functions *Done*
3. CouchDB style config files *Done*
4. Resharding controlled through the config file. The [routing] section is the
   original routing config. [resharding] is the intended routing config. Call
   pillow_routing_table:reshard() to start replicating to the new nodes. Observe
   that the replication completed before executing pillow_routing_table:flip() to
   start using the new nodes. flip also updates the config. At this point, the old
   servers may be torn down. *Done*
5. End-to-end resharding through a single call. Pillow will wait until replication is
   complete before flipping to the new servers. Tearing down the old ones will still
   be manual.
6. Daemonize Pillow and add control script that will also control resharding.
7. Monitoring UI that will show stats and general health of Pillow.
