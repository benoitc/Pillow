Pillow is a combined router and rereducer for CouchDB.

Dependencies (Both of these are included in this git repository):
- webmachine
- ibrowse from jungerl

Needless to say, it also depends indirectly on couchdb. There is no direct dependencies, but what use is a router
or rereducer for CouchDB without CouchDB. 

Roadmap:
The current goal is to add resharding to Pillow. 
1. Automatic generation of resharding filters
2. Automatic resharding using filters
